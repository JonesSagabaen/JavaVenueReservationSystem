JavaVenueReservationSystem
==========================

A text-based reservation application written in Java. 
The purpose of the application is to act as a reserveration system for a business venue that possess 
two available rooms.  The user is able to request reservations for a single seat or a group of seats for a 
specific date, time and duration.  The application is also capable of printing an output file that will 
record saved reservations into the system.  This then can be used to load the reservation schedule back 
to the application when launching the app from a full restart.

Upon launching the application, the console will print statements that will prompt the user to respond.  
The application is flexible enough to handle responses outside of the expected input.  The application is 
programmed to respond with an error statement providing useful feedback to the user.
